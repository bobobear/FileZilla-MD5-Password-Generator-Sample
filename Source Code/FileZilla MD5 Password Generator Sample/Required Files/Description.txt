FileZilla MD5 Password Generator Sample

FileZilla FTP Server uses a simple xml file to store its user account information. I have an interest in automating FTP account creation for this server, and this application shows how to generate the MD5 hash that FileZilla uses for its password storage. The application makes use of Visual Studio's built in System.Cryptography NameSpace.
